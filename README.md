Remove duplicates and nulls.
Normalize inconsistent data entries (e.g., outlet sizes, item types).
**3. Data Modeling in Power BI:**
Defined calculated columns and measures using DAX for:
Total Sales, Average Sales, No. of Items, Rating Trends, Yearly Growth
**4. Dashboard Design & Visualization:**
Designed an intuitive and interactive dashboard using:
Slicers for Outlet Type, Size, Location, Fat Content, and Item Type.
KPI cards for high-level business metrics.
Bar/column charts for sales by item, outlet type, and fat content.
Line graphs for time series insights (e.g., establishment trends).
Donut and pie charts for category breakdowns.
**5. Insight Generation:**
Generated business recommendations (e.g., focusing on high-performing outlet types, understanding regional sales behavior).
Structured findings into a data story suitable for stakeholders
**6. Used SQL to:**
Clean data, Remove duplicates and nulls.
